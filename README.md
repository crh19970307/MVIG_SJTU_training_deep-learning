#MVIG_SJTU_training_deep-learning

##Environment setting

I have installed ubuntu 16.04 LTS in my computer with NVIDIA graphic card. I have installed caffe, tensorflow and torch in my computer successfully. There are many problems when installing caffe so I spend a few days. I have also installed CUDA8.0, CUDNN v3, OpenCV3.0.

##Course CS231n

This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for tasks such as image classification, localization and detection, particularly image classification.
I find videos on the youtube. The page of cs231n in cs231n.github.io has been removed but I found another page with notes and assignments. A group in Zhihu has translated the course into Chinese so that I can understand the course more easily.
